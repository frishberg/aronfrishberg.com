It should be noted that this dataset is only as accurate as wikipedia - alma matter lists are scraped from here.

                    <h2>University Hex Colors</h2>
                    <p>This repo contains the primary hex color codes associated with 2000+ universities in the United States.  I was working with the Department of Education's Scoreboard data for another project and had to create this, so I figured I would spin 
                        this data set off so others could use it.  Using the DOE's list of 2000+ undergrad universities in the US, I coded a program using Perplexity's AI API to scrape each of their primary hex colors.  I stored the data in .json file to allow 
                        for easy use across all languages, or easy modification in the case .json is not supported by a language.  This data is also used in my US News Graphing Tool to determine the color of each schools graph.

                    <h2>Ivy Plus Endowment Data (2014 - 2024)</h2>
                    <p>For this repo, I manually went through the endowment data of all Ivy Plus schools (Ivy League + UChicago, Stanford, Duke, CalTech, Hopkins, MIT) and compiled it into a .csv and a .xlsx file.  The data is from 2014 - 2024, and contains the endowment value of each school for each year.  This data is useful for anyone interested in the financials of these schools, or for anyone interested in the financials of schools in general.  This data is also used in my "Graph of Ivy Plus Endowments" project, which can be found on the Projects page.

                    <h2>Record Labels of the Billboard Top 100 Artists</h2>
                    <p>This repo contains the current list of Billboard Top 100 Artists and their record labels, listed on Wikipedia.  The scraping function runs daily through github (at midnight UTC) so the data is always current.  There are some errors, as the data is scraped from Wikipedia, an openly modifiable website, but the data is accurate for the most part.

                    <h2>Nobel Prizes by Academic Affiliations</h2>
                    <p>This repo contains the lifetime academic affiliations of all nobel laureates (1901 - 2024).  Academic affiliations are divided into alma matters and institutions.  For example, Moungi Bawendi (2023) recieved his PhD from UChicago and is now a professor at MIT, so both are listed in their respective categories.  It should be noted that this dataset is only as accurate as wikipedia.  For example, UChicago has 101 nobel prizes as of 2024, yet this dataset only contains 98, as not all laureates have all of their academic affiliations listed on wikipedia.

                    <h2>Archive of U.S. News College Rankings (1984 - 2024)</h2>
                    <p>This repo contains an archive of all US News national college rankings from 1984 to 2024.  I collected the ranking data from several sources (including publicuniversityhonors.com andyreiter.com/datasets) utiziling Python and the selenium library.
                    This dataset contains a total of ~6000 datapoints, and contains the data in many formats (.csv, .json, .xlsx) in order to allow for use across all languages.  To see this visually displayed, check out the "Graphing Tool" on Projects.</p>

                    <h2>U.S. College Ranking Data</h2>
                    <p>This repo contains data points on many of the top universities in the United States.  I spent weeks coding Python programs (utilizing the selenium and requests libraries) scraping data points that range from 
                        all Niche rankings (campus food quality, safety, professors, ...), acceptance rate, average SAT, # of nobel prizes won, international rankings, cs rankings, and more.  I collected all of this data to create a custom college ranking site but figured I should publish the data as a standalone as well, for others to use.
