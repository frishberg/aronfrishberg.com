                            created this page, which allows for analysis of the data. This includes filters to allow for

                        <p class="article-content">A few years ago, I decided to research the prevalence of major record

                            although there is a rise in popular independent artists with the democratization of
                            technology and information.</p>
                        <p class="article-content">With this project, I wanted to create a tool to analyze the labels of
                            the Billboard Top 100 Artists. I coded it so that the data would be updated daily (as can be
                            seen in Datasets) so the tool will always be a live analysis of the major labels behind the

                            flawlessly. On the other hand, I'm barely breaking 900 elo on chess.com, so I thought it
                            would be interesting to create an engine that ran off of my moves.</p>
                        <p class="article-content">Over the course of the next week or so, I ended up doing just that.
                            It involved interfacing with the chess.com API, and a bunch of work.</p>

                            a few months later, I had the idea of creating a Python library that made chess analytics
                            way easier (by making both scraping and analysis simpler). That is the story of how

                        <p class="article-content">This all began with a simple idea: an "indestructible" chess
                            structure. Looking at a
                            pawn to the back left of a bishop, we see that they each protect eachother, thus making an
                            "indestructible" chess structure.
                            I had the idea to take this further though. As a result, I coded a complex Python program
                            that created chess structures
                            until it created the "optimal" structure.</p>
                        <p class="article-content">The basic idea behind it was to find a structure of pieces where
                            every piece was protected by another, and every piece was
                            protecting at least one other piece. <b>Click to continue.</b></p>

                        <p class="article-content">In 8th grade, I had the idea for a mathematical theory: 01 Theory.
                            The basic idea is that if you analyzed all numbers, from negative to positive infinity, and
                            counted the number of '1's and '0's that appeared in
                            the numbers (ex. 10165 has 2 '1's and 1 '0') that the 1s would not only out number the 0s,
                            but by an infinite amount.
                        </p>

                        <p class="article-content">This is due to the simple fact that a number can start with a 1 but
                            not a 0. In any place that a 0 can appear, a 1 could take its place, but this is not correct
                            the other way around, due to the fact that a number
                            can start with a 1. As a result, there will be an infinite number more 1s than 0s.
                        </p>

                        <p class="article-content">Using my new programming skills, I coded a program in Python that
                            analyzes the ratio between 1s and 0s and uses MatPlotLib to create a graph. The graph can be
                            seen above. As can be seen,
                            the ratio always remains above 1, as there will always be more 1s than 0s, however, the
                            graph tends downward (to an asymptote of 1) as the numbers get larger.
                        </p>

                        <p class="article-content">Analysis: This is because if we think about why the ratio is above 1
                            at all, is because of the first digits of numbers. <b>Click to continue.</b></p>

                        <p class="article-content">Collatz Conjecture (or the 3n+1 problem) is a famous idea within the
                            field of mathematics.
                            It is known in the field for being an unsolvable problem with "experienced mathematicians
                            even going as far as warning up-and-comers to stay away". The idea behind the conjecture is
                            actually quite simple:
                            taking any number, if it is even, divide it by 2, and if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add
                            1. Continue this process
                            until you reach 1. The conjecture states that no matter what number you start with, you will
                            always reach 1. Mathematicians
                            have tried for ages find a pattern in this process, but all have failed. <b>Click to
