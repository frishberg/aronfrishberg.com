            <p class="article-content"><b>*Update</b>: As of January 2025, Billboard stopped listing the labels of each artist.  As such, this data will no longer update daily (as it once did) - I permanently froze the data at the last point where they did include labels.</p>

            <p class="article-content">A while back I set out to research major record labels, and went through each
                artist on the Billboard Top 100, looking at their labels and what their labels' parent companies were.
                It was a super long process and resulted in a pretty expected list: the major labels dominated the
                industry.</p>
            <p class="article-content">I decided it would be a super interesting project to automate this research. On
                the back-end of this project, I created a dataset on GitHub, which can be found <b><a
                        href="https://github.com/frishberg/Record-Labels-of-the-Top-100-Artists">here</a></b>, which
                scrapes the Billboard Top 100 list, and then scrapes the wikipedia page of each artist, finding all
                labels listed in their "infobox". It's important to note that this will include previous labels and
                won't be able to detect if a company is a subsidiary of another (like RCA being owned by Sony).</p>
            <p class="article-content">I then coded a workflow for the GitHub repo that automates the script to run
                daily, so the data is current every day. Pairing it with chart.js and some front-end code, you get the
                graph above, and the full lists of artists labels.</p>
