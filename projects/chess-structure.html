            <h2>Frishberg Chess Structure</h2>
            <img src="../img/frishberg-chess-structure.PNG" alt="Frishberg Chess Structure"

            <p class="article-content">This all began with a simple idea: an "indestructible" chess structure. Looking
                at a
                pawn to the back left of a bishop, we see that they each protect eachother, thus making an
                "indestructible" chess structure.
                I had the idea to take this further though. As a result, I coded a complex Python program that created
                chess structures
                until it created the "optimal" structure.</p>
            <p class="article-content">The basic idea behind it was to find a structure of pieces where every piece was
                protected by another, and every piece was
                protecting at least one other piece. Furthermore, it would be using all 16 white pieces. Once completing
                this, I was presented with a few structures, but they were really apart and in my opinion, inefficient.
                At this point in the project, I had a few ideas, but one really hit me. Optimize the structure for the
                "number of protections".
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">To give a specific and simple example, imagine a board with rooks in the top left
                and bottom right, as well as a queen in the bottom left. The rooks both protect the queen, but the queen
                protects both rooks (2 pieces). This would count as
                2 "protections" for the queen, and a total of 4 "protections" for the structure. My idea was that if I
                optimized for this, it would slowly shape to be the most efficient board, and really intertwined, as you
                got closer to the maximum number of "protections". After
                days of coding and waiting for my 2019 PC to compute, I was presented with the structure above, which
                has a total of 38 "protections" (average of 2.2 "protections" per piece). Although it doesn't exactly
                translate over to the chess board, it covers more of the theory, and I thought the idea was really
                interesting overall.
