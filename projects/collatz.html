            <p class="article-content">Collatz Conjecture (or the 3n+1 problem) is a famous idea within the
                field of mathematics.
                It is known in the field for being an unsolvable problem with "experienced mathematicians
                even going as far as warning up-and-comers to stay away". The idea behind the conjecture is
                actually quite simple:
                taking any number, if it is even, divide it by 2, and if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add
                1. Continue this process
                until you reach 1. The conjecture states that no matter what number you start with, you will
                always reach 1. Mathematicians
                have tried for ages find a pattern in this process, but all have failed.</p>
            <p class="article-content">I had the idea to create art from this conjecture a few years ago, and decided to
                finally
                take up the project. My motivation was that
                in displaying the pattern visually, I might be able to figure something out, but I also
                figured that no matter what, it would come out looking
                pretty cool.
            </p>
            <p class="article-content">Looking at the art, each "pixel" or square, represents one value. The top left
                pixel in each
                generated image represents the value 1, and the value to its right represents 2 and so on.
                The color that each square recieves is a result of running collatz conjecture on a given
                number. For example, the value 3 would follow this sequence (3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 ->
                2 -> 1). This is a total of 7 fluctuations.
                The art depicts the number of fluctuations. For the rainbow generated images, the color is
                determined using modulus, as there are only 6 colors used, so the color is determined by
                colors[fluctuations%6]. For the "heat map" (or orange) generated images,
                it displays the pure fluctuation values, with a color being closer to orange representing a
                higher number of fluctuations.
